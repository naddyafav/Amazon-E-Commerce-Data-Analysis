# Background and Overview: 
The goal of the project is to investigate the performance of various demographics in a sample of Amazon users in order to develop actionable recommendations for future marketing strategies. This analysis aims to provide insights that can guide targeted campaigns, improve customer engagement, and support long-term growth initiatives. 

The Amazon purchase dataset was collected through an online survey administered via Prolific and CloudResearch. Eligible participants were U.S. residents aged 18 or older with active Amazon accounts in use since 2018. Each participant received $0.35 for a brief prescreen and $1.50 for completing the main survey. With informed consent, they shared their purchase history, forming the dataset for this analysis. The data spans 2018â€“2022, but for relevancy the analysis focuses on more recent purchasing behavior, excluding years with limited participation.

## Clarifying Questions
* **Data Gaps:** Thousands of rows in amazon_purchases contained missing values for title and category. These fields were normalized to "Unknown" to since every record had an asin_isbn. 
* **Date Range:** Although the dataset documentation indicates coverage through 2022, the raw data included 3,506 purchases from 2023 and one record from 2024. Clarification is needed on whether these transactions should be retained or excluded for accuracy. 
* **Geographic Labels:** District of Columbia appeared in the data but is not a U.S. state. Guidance is required on whether to treat it as a separate region, merge it with surrounding states, or exclude it from state-level comparisons.
